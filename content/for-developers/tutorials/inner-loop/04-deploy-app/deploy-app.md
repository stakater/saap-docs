# Deploy your Application

There are multiple ways to deploy your Application on the Cluster.

- For development with tilt follow below tutorial. Use tilt for deploying the application on test clusters.

    > This the recommended local development workflow

- For Deployment via GitOps, follow [this](../../../../for-delivery-engineers/tutorials/03-deploy-demo-app/deploy-demo-app.md) guide for Deploying the Application with GitOps

    > This is the recommended production workflow

## Objective

Learn local development for testing and developing applications on local/lab clusters.

## Key Results

- Create a Tiltfile for your application.

- Deploy the application with tilt.

## Tutorial

In this guide we will deploy an application with tilt and namespace in remote OpenShift cluster

1. Clone this sample repo [Nordmart-review](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-review)

1. You should have a namespace in remote/local cluster; If you are in SAAP then enable sandbox namespace/project/environment for your tenant; you can read more [here](https://docs.stakater.com/mto/main/customresources.html)

1. Login to cluster via `OpenShift CLI`, copy the login command from your `username` tab as discussed in the previous tutorial.

1. Switch project to sandbox namespace/project/environment

    ```bash
    oc project <MY-SANDBOX>
    ```

1. Login to OpenShift internal docker registry

    First get the OpenShift internal docker registry URL and set in HOST variable name

    ```bash
    HOST=image-registry-openshift-image-registry.apps.[CLUSTER-NAME].[CLUSTER-ID].kubeapp.cloud
    ```

    NOTE: Ask `sca` (SAAP Cluster Admin) or `cluster-admin` to provide you the OpenShift internal registry route

    Then login into docker registry with following command:

    ```bash
    docker login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) $HOST
    ```

    If you get this error `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` then you need to update your `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file and add the insecure registry

    ```bash
    {
        "insecure-registries" : [ "HOST" ]
    }
    ```

1. (Optional) Add Helm chart repos

    If you reference Helm charts from private registry then you first need to add it

    ```sh
    cd deploy

    # Helm credentials can be found in Vault or in a secret in build namespace
    helm repo add stakater-nexus <private repo URL> --username helm-user-name --password ********

    cd ..
    ```

1. Update Helm dependencies.

    ```sh
    cd deploy

    helm dependency update

    cd ..
    ```

1. Go through the [Tiltfile](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-review/blob/main/Tiltfile) of the application

1. Check the `local_resource` section in the Tiltfile

1. Create `tilt_options.json` file

    Remove `.template` from the file named `tilt_options.json.template`

    ![Create tilt_options.json](images/tilt-options-json.png)

    And then fill up all three things

      1. `namespace`: your sandbox environment name
      1. `default_registry`: the OpenShift internal registry route (you have set in step # 6 in HOST above) and then add your namespace name after `/`
      1. `allow_k8s_contexts`: given you are logged in the cluster; then run `oc config current-context` to get the value for `allow_k8s_contexts`

          e.g.

          ```json
          {
              "namespace": "tilt-username-sandbox",
              "default_registry": "image-registry-openshift-image-registry.apps.[CLUSTER-NAME].[CLUSTER-ID].kubeapp.cloud/tilt-username-sandbox",
              "allow_k8s_contexts": "tilt-username-sandbox/api-[CLUSTER-NAME]-[CLUSTER-ID]-kubeapp-cloud:6443/user@email.com"
          }
          ```

1. Go through the `.gitigore` and check tilt and Helm specific ignores

    ```sh
    # ignore tilt files
    tilt_options.json
    tilt_modules/

    # ignores helm files
    /deploy/charts
    ```

1. Go through `.tiltignore`.

    ```sh
    **/charts
    **/tmpcharts
    ```

1. Go through `values-local.yaml` in a `tilt` folder in base application directory.

    `values-local.yaml` should contain the following content. Make sure that replica count should always be 1.

    ```yaml
    application:
        
      deployment:
        imagePullSecrets: null

        # Tilt live update only supports one replica
        replicas: 1

        image:
          tag: null
    ```

1. Validate this application is not running already

    ![sandbox namespace](images/sandbox-env-b4-tilt-up.png)

1. Run `tilt up` at base directory

    ![tilt up](images/tilt-up.png)

    Open the tilt browser; just hit the space

    ![tilt browser](images/tilt-browser.png)

    If everything is green then the application will be deployed in the cluster

    ![sandbox namespace](images/sandbox-env-after-tilt-up.png)

    Press space key to view the progress in Tilt web UI. The application should be running in the namespace used in `tilt_options.json` file.

1. In your Tiltfile, there is a port forwarding command written, this command will forward the port of the application to your local machine. To see the output of the deployment:

    ```sh
    curl localhost:8080/api/review/329199
    ```

    Review the json output

    ![product review](images/product-review-json-b4-change.png)

1. Lets make one change; we will update the first review text to "Tilt Demo"

    ![update review service](images/review-service-to-update.png)

    Switch back to tilt browser, you will see it has started picking up changes

    ![tilt pick up change](images/tilt-picking-up-change.png)

    Within few seconds the change will be deployed; and you can refresh the route to see the change

    ![updated review](images/product-review-json-after-change.png)

    Awesome! you made it

1. Run `tilt down` to delete the application and related configuration from the namespace
