### Setting up CLI

The following CLI tools are required for working with the {{ product_name }}.

- [OpenShift CLI (oc)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#cli-installing-cli-web-console_cli-developer-commands) With the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI), the oc command, you can create applications and manage OpenShift Container Platform projects from a terminal.

    You can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) binary on Linux by using the following procedure.

    **Procedure**

    1. From the web console, click ?.

    1. Select appropriate oc binary for your Linux platform, and then click **Download oc for Linux**.

    1. Save the file.
    1. Unpack the archive.

        ```shell
        tar xvf <file>
        ```

    1. Move the **oc** binary to a directory that is on your **PATH**.
    1. To check your **PATH**, execute the following command:

        ```shell
        echo $PATH
        ```

    1. After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the **oc** command:

        ```shell
        oc <command>
        ```

- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications — Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)/[podman](https://podman.io/) Docker/Podman is an open platform for developing, shipping and running applications in containers. Docker/Podman enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure, so you can deliver software quickly.

- [tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html) Tilt powers microservice development and ensures they behave! Run tilt up to work in a complete dev environment configured for your team. Tilt automates all the steps from a code change to a new process: watching files, building container images, and bringing your environment up-to-date. Think docker build && kubectl apply or docker-compose up.
