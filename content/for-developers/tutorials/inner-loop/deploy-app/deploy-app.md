# Deploy your Application

There are multiple ways to deploy your Application on the Cluster.

- For development with tilt follow the below tutorial. Use tilt for deploying the application on test clusters.

    > This is the recommended local development workflow

- For Deployment via GitOps, follow [this](../../../../for-devops-engineers/tutorials/03-deploy-demo-app/deploy-demo-app.md) guide for Deploying the Application with GitOps

    > This is the recommended production workflow

## Objective

- Learn local development for testing and developing applications on local/lab clusters.

## Key Results

- Deploy the application with tilt.
- Deploy the dependency of the application.

## Tutorial

In this guide, we will deploy an application with tilt and namespace in the remote OpenShift cluster

1. Clone this sample repo [Nordmart-review](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-review)

1. You should have a namespace in remote/local cluster; If you are in {{ product_name }} then enable sandbox namespace/project/environment for your tenant; you can read more [here](https://docs.stakater.com/mto/main/customresources.html)

1. Log in to the cluster via `OpenShift CLI`, and copy the login command from your `username` tab as discussed in the previous tutorial.

1. Switch project to sandbox namespace/project/environment

    ```bash
    oc project <MY-SANDBOX>
    ```

1. Log in to OpenShift internal docker registry

    First, get the OpenShift internal docker registry URL and set in the HOST variable name

    ```bash
    HOST=image-registry-openshift-image-registry.apps.[CLUSTER-NAME].[CLUSTER-ID].kubeapp.cloud
    ```

    NOTE: Ask Customer Admin or Cluster Admin to provide you with the OpenShift internal registry route

    Then login into the docker registry with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) $HOST
    ```

    If you get this error `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` then you need to update your `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file and add the insecure registry

    ```bash
    {
        "insecure-registries" : [ "HOST" ]
    }
    ```

1. (Optional) Add Helm chart repos

    If you reference Helm charts from the private registry then you first need to add it

    ```sh
    cd deploy

    # Helm credentials can be found in Vault or in secret in the build namespace
    helm repo add stakater-nexus <private repo URL> --username helm-user-name --password ********

    cd ..
    ```

1. Update Helm dependencies.

    ```sh
    cd deploy

    helm dependency update

    cd ..
    ```

1. Go through the [Tiltfile](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-review/blob/main/Tiltfile) of the application

1. Check the `local_resource` section in the Tiltfile

1. Create `tilt_options.json` file

    Remove `.template` from the file named `tilt_options.json.template`

    ![Create tilt options JSON](images/tilt-options-json.png)

    And then fill up all three things

      1. `namespace`: your sandbox environment name
      1. `default_registry`: the OpenShift internal registry route (you have set in step # 6 in HOST above) and then add your namespace name after `/`
      1. `allow_k8s_contexts`: given you are logged in the cluster; then run `oc config current-context` to get the value for `allow_k8s_contexts`

          e.g.

          ```json
          {
              "namespace": "tilt-username-sandbox",
              "default_registry": "image-registry-openshift-image-registry.apps.[CLUSTER-NAME].[CLUSTER-ID].kubeapp.cloud/tilt-username-sandbox",
              "allow_k8s_contexts": "tilt-username-sandbox/api-[CLUSTER-NAME]-[CLUSTER-ID]-kubeapp-cloud:6443/user@email.com"
          }
          ```

1. Go through the `.gitigore` and check tilt and Helm specific ignores

    ```sh
    # ignore tilt files
    tilt_options.json
    tilt_modules/

    # ignores helm files
    /deploy/charts
    ```

1. Go through `.tiltignore`.

    ```sh
    **/charts
    **/tmpcharts
    ```

1. Go through `values-local.yaml` in a `tilt` folder in the base application directory.

    `values-local.yaml` should contain the following content. Make sure that the replica count should always be 1.

    ```yaml
    application:

      deployment:
        imagePullSecrets: null

        # Tilt live update only supports one replica
        replicas: 1

        image:
          tag: null
    ```

    In our application setup, we have a dependency on MongoDB for storing and managing data. As part of our deployment process, we will ensure that both the application `API` named `review` and `MongoDB` named `review-mongodb` are deployed together to confirm proper functioning. This dependency ensures that the application can interact with the database and access the necessary data. To understand more about application architecture, visit [here](../about-application/about-application.md).

1. To add `mongodb` dependency, add this YAML to your `deploy/values.yaml` file.

    ```yaml
    mongodb:
      fullnameOverride: review-mongodb  # Name for the MongoDB deployment
      updateStrategy:  # Specify the update strategy for MongoDB pods
        type: Recreate
      resources:  # Define resource limits and requests for MongoDB
        limits:
          memory: 1Gi
          cpu: 0.5
        requests:
          memory: 128Mi
          cpu: 0.1
      auth:  # Enable authentication for MongoDB
        enabled: true
        existingSecret: review-mongodb-creds  # Reference an external secret for MongoDB credentials (created via Vault)
      podSecurityContext:  # Disable or enable if you require pod-level security context settings for MongoDB
        enabled: false
      containerSecurityContext:  # Disable or enable if you require container-level security context settings for MongoDB
        enabled: false
    ```

    It should look like this:

    ![MongoDB values](images/mongodb-values.png)

    !!! note
        The indentation should be followed as `mongodb`. So you can define `MongoDB values` as a separate entity, because we are going to deploy a separate pod named, `review-mongodb`.

1. Validate that the `review` application is not running already

    ![sandbox namespace](images/sandbox-env-b4-tilt-up.png)

1. Save the `values.yaml` file and run `tilt up` at the base directory of your repository.

    ![tilt up](images/tilt-up.png)

    Open the tilt browser; just hit the space

    ![tilt browser](images/tilt-browser.png)

    If everything is green then the application will be deployed in the cluster. By this we mean two pods will and 2 deployments will be created.

    ![sandbox namespace](images/pods.png)

    Let's view your application pods

    ![pods error](images/pods-error.png)

    We can see there is an error on both API and MongoDB pods. Let's see the events of both pods to find the actual error:

    ![review pod error](images/event-review.png)
    ![MongoDB pod error](images/events-mongodb.png)

    There is a secret missing named, `review-mongodb-creds`.

Let's create this secret in the next chapter and deploy the app.
