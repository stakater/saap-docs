# Promote your Application

To promote application from one environment to another; as mentioned above you will need to bump chart version and image tag version in that environment. You can do so by picking these versions from previous environment.

This guide assumes that application is already [on-boarded](../../../../for-devops-engineers/tutorials/03-deploy-demo-app/deploy-demo-app.md) to different environments.

## 1. Promote chart

To promote application from one environment to another, you can check the chart version from `Chart.yaml` file from one environment and update version in `Chart.yaml` of next environment:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
dependencies:
  - name: <application-name>
    repository: <application-chart-repo>
    version: 1.0.51
description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes
name: <application-name>
version: 1.0.51
```

pick version `1.0.51` from above `Chart.yaml` and copy it in `Chart.yaml` of next environment

## 2. Promote image

To promote application from one environment to another, you can check the image tag version from `values.yaml` file from one environment and update version in `values.yaml` of next environment:

`<gitops-repo>/<tenant>/<application>/<env-1>/values.yaml`

```yaml
<application-name>:
  application:
    deployment:
      image:
        repository: nexus-docker-stakater-nexus.{CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/
        tag: 1.0.51
```

  > Note: Find Harbor Docker registry URL and Helm Registry URL [here](../../../../managed-addons/nexus/explanation/routes.md)

Pick version `1.0.51` and paste it to next environment

`<gitops-repo>/<tenant>/<application>/<env-2>/values.yaml`

```yaml
<application-name>:
  application:
    deployment:
      image:
        repository: nexus-docker-stakater-nexus.{CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/
        tag: 1.0.50
```
