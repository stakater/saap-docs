## Tutorial

### Create PipelineRun with Trivy Scan Task

You have already created a PipelineRun in the previous tutorial. Let's now add another task [`trivy-scan`](https://github.com/stakater-tekton-catalog/trivy-scan) to it.

1. Open up the PipelineRun file you created in the previous tutorial.
1. Now edit the file so the YAML becomes like the one given below.

<!-- vale off -->
{% raw %}

    ```yaml
    {% include "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NordMart/review-api/main/.tekton/trivy_scan.yaml" %}
    ```

{% endraw %}
<!-- vale on -->

    !!! note
        Remember to add the remote task in the annotations

1. Create a pull request with you changes. This should trigger the pipeline in the build namespace.

Great! Let's add more tasks in our `pipelineRun` in coming tutorials.
