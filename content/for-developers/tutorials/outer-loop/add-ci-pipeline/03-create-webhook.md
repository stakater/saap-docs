# Setting Up Webhook

The webhook setup acts as a bridge between your code repository and the CI/CD pipeline. It allows your pipeline to be triggered automatically whenever specific events occur in your repository, such as code pushes or pull requests. The webhook secret further ensures that these interactions are secured and authenticated.

## Objectives

- Obtain Interceptor URL from {{ product_name }} admin.
- Create Webhook Secret for your webhook security.
- Add webhook in your source code repository.

## Key Results

- Established a webhook connection between GitHub and your pipeline.
- Created a webhook secret for secure communication.

## Tutorial

### Creating Webhook in GitHub

1. Begin by accessing the repository where you plan to set up the webhook. In your source code GitHub repository, locate and click on the `Settings` tab.

    ![Repository settings](images/repository-settings.png)

1. Within the repository settings, navigate to the `Webhooks` section. This is where you can manage and configure webhooks for your repository.

    ![Webhook](images/webhook.png)

1. Click on the option to `Add a new webhook` to initiate the process of creating a new webhook for your repository.

    ![Webhook](images/add-webhook.png)

1. To set up the webhook, you'll need the `URL of the pipeline-as-code interceptor`. This URL is used to connect GitHub with your {{ product_name }}'s pipeline system.

1. Ask the {{ product_name }} admin to provide you with the `Interceptor URL` "route" from the project or namespace where the pipeline-as-code is installed.

1. Back in the GitHub repository's webhook settings, enter the `pipeline-as-code interceptor URL` you obtained in the previous step in the `Payload URL`.

1. Choose `Content type` as `application/json`.

1. Let's create a secret for our webhook to make it secure. Open up a terminal and generate a random secret with this command.

    ```sh
    openssl rand -hex 20
    ```

    Now copy it and paste it under `Secret` section in Webhook.

    !!! note
        Save the secret because we will need it later when we add it in to Vault.

1. Choose the specific events that should trigger the webhook. Click “Let me select individual events” and select the following events to trigger the webhook:

    - Commit status
    - Issue comments
    - Pushes
    - pull requests

1. Click on `Add webhook`/`Update webhook`.

    Once you've entered the interceptor URL and chosen the triggering events, proceed to add the webhook. This will establish the connection between your GitHub repository and {{ product_name }} pipeline.

    !!! note
        For GitLab Webhook configuration follow [this](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/install/gitlab/), for Bitbucket webhook configuration follow [this](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/install/bitbucket_cloud/).

### Adding Webhook Secret to Vault

1. Access Vault from `Forecastle` console, search `Vault` and open the `Vault` tile.

    ![Forecastle](images/forecastle.png)

1. From the drop-down menu under `Method`, select `OIDC` and click on `Sign in with OIDC Provider`.

    ![login-oidcs](images/login-oidc.png)

1. You will be brought to the `Vault` console. You should see the key/value path for <your-tenant>.

    ![Vault tenant](images/vault-tenant.png)

1. Click on `<your-tenant>/kv/`.

1. You will now be brought to the `secrets` and the `configurations` in Vault for <your-tenant>. Click on `create secret`.

    ![create-secret](images/create-secret.png)

1. Let's create a `github-webhook-config` secret for our webhook secret. Write the name of the secret in `path` which is `github-webhook-config`. Add `secret data`, key: `webhook.secret`, value: (your webhook secret). Hit save.

### Add External Secret

1. Head over to the `apps-gitops-config` repository.

1. If you have followed the tutorial on configuring `apps-gitops-config` repository correctly, you should already have your tenant folder at the root of this repository. Open the tenant folder.

1. Navigate to the application folder. In our case it will be `stakater-nordmart-review-api`

1. Now open up the `build` folder.

1. Create a file named `github-webhook-config.yaml` and add in the below content. Replace the URL with your application repository's URL.

<!-- vale off -->
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
    kind: ExternalSecret
    metadata:
    name: github-webhook-config
    spec:
    secretStoreRef:
         name: tenant-vault-secret-store
         kind: SecretStore
    refreshInterval: "1m0s"
    target:
         name: github-webhook-config
         creationPolicy: 'Owner'
         template:
         data:
         provider.token: "{{ .password | toString }}"
         webhook.secret: "{{ .secret | toString }}"
    data:
         - secretKey: password
         remoteRef:
         key: github-webhook-config
         property: provider.token
         - secretKey: secret
         remoteRef:
         key: github-webhook-config
         property: webhook.secret
    ```
<!-- vale on -->

    ![GitHub-webhook-config-es](images/github-webhook-config-es.png)

1. Now open up ArgoCD and look for this External Secret. If everything was added correctly, you will see a secret created from this External Secret.

    ![GitHub-webhook-config-argo](images/github-webhook-config-argo.png)

1. You can also check this secret by navigation to `<tenant>-build` namespace and searching for the secret.

Great! We have everything set up for creating the Repository CR.
