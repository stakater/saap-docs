# Secrets

The following secrets are needed for running a fully functional pipeline using pipeline-as-code. Some of the secrets are auto-distributed in the build namespaces of all tenants. Organization level secrets will be deployed through the infra repository. Repository and application level secrets will be deployed through GitOps repository.

## {{ product_name }} Managed Secrets

1. `sonar-creds`
    * _Purpose_: Used by `sonarqube-scan` pipeline task.
    * _Owner_: {{ product_name }} admins.
    * _Type_: Login credentials for SonarQube.
    * _Used for_: For running SonarQube scan in pipeline.
    * _Lifecycle_: Every time a new tenant is created, the secret gets deployed in the build namespace. SonarQube credentials are not rotated and remain the same.
    * _Comment_: The origin of this secret is the SonarQube namespace. Secret is copied over to build namespace using an MTO template and Template Group Instance.
    * _Deployment Process_: The SonarQube deployed on {{ product_name }} contains a secret named `sonar-creds` in its namespace. This secret contains the username and password for SonarQube. We use a Multi Tenant Operator Template and TemplateGroupInstance to copy this secret and distribute it the build namespaces of all tenants. The Template and TemplateGroupInstance are both named `sonar-creds`.
1. `docker-reg-creds`
    * _Purpose_: Used by buildah task and the application deployment to pull the image from the nexus registry.
    * _Owner_: {{ product_name }} admins.
    * _Type_: Login credentials for nexus docker registry. The secret itself is of type `dockerconfigjson`.
    * _Used for_: Pulling images from the nexus registry. Needs to be deployed in all namespaces of the tenant. We distribute it using a TGI.
    * _Lifecycle_: Every time a new tenant is created, the secret gets deployed in all its namespaces.
    * _Deployment Process_: Nexus comes shipped with {{ product_name }}. The `nexus3` namespace contains a secret named `docker-reg-creds`. This secret contains the .`dockerconfigjson` file. We use a Multi Tenant Operator Template and TemplateGroupInstance to copy this secret and distribute it all namespaces of the tenants. The Template and TemplateGroupInstance are both named `docker-reg-creds`.
1. `helm-reg-creds`
    * _Purpose_: Used to pull and push charts from the Nexus Helm Registry. We use it in two places for our pipeline:
        1. `stakater-helm-push` task
        1. ArgoCD to fetch the helm chart
    * _Owner_: {{ product_name }} Admins.
    * _Used for_: Pulling charts from Nexus.
    * _Lifecycle_: Every time a new tenant is created, the secret gets deployed in the build namespace. The same secret is deployed in the `rh-openshift-gitops-instance` when {{ product_name }} is provisioned.
    * _Deployment Process_: Nexus comes shipped with {{ product_name }}. The `nexus3` namespace contains a secret named `helm-reg-creds`. This secret contains the username and password for the helm registry. We use a Multi Tenant Operator Template and TemplateGroupInstance to copy this secret and distribute it all namespaces of the tenants. The Template and TemplateGroupInstance are both named `helm-reg-creds`. Another TGI named `helm-reg-creds-gitops` deploys the secret in GitOps namespace so ArgoCD can fetch the charts.
1. `rox-creds`
    * _Purpose_: Used by three Tekton Tasks:
        1. `stakater-rox-deployment-check`
        1. `stakater-rox-image-check`
        1. `stakater-rox-image-scan`
    * _Owner_: {{ product_name }} admins
    * _Used for_: Communicating with RHACS API to scan images and deployments
    * _Lifecycle_: Created at the time of RHACS deployment. The secret is then copied over to build namespaces of tenants.
    * _Comment_: Needs to be deployed in build namespace. We deploy it using TGI.
    * _Deployment Process_: After StackRox is installed on the {{ product_name }} cluster. An API token is created and stored in the rox-creds secret in the `stakater-stackrox` namespaces. We then use a Template and a TemplateGroupInstance with the same name to distribute the secret in the build namespace of tenants.

## Customer Managed Secrets

### ArgoCD authentication with `infra-gitops-config` Repository

1. `infra-gitops-creds`
    * _Purpose_: This secret is added so ArgoCD can sync the repository. You can either use an ssh key or a personal access token for this purpose.
    * _Owner_: The owner of this secret will be customer's delivery engineer
    * _Location_: The secret will be deployed in the `rh-openshift-gitops-instance` namespace.
    * _Used for_: Use only for the purpose of syncing your infra GitOps repository with ArgoCD
    * _Format_: Given below is the template for this secret. The secret/external secret will need to have `argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: repository` label on it:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: private-repo
          namespace: argocd
        labels:
           argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: repository
        stringData:
          type: git
          url: git@github.com:argoproj/my-private-repository
          sshPrivateKey: |
            -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
            ...
            -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
        ```

    * _Scopes_: When creating personal access token for this, token should have the following scopes attached.
    ![`PAT scopes`](./images/pat-scopes-for-infra-gitops-config.png)
    * _Comment_: This secret needs to be deployed on the cluster directly.

    !!! note
        These secrets need to go into your Infra GitOps Repository

### ArgoCD authentication with `apps-gitops-config` Repository

1. `apps-gitops-creds`
    * _Purpose_: This secret is added so ArgoCD can sync the `apps-gitops-config` repository.
    * _Owner_: The owner of this secret will be customer's delivery engineer
    * _Location_: The secret will be deployed in the `rh-openshift-gitops-instance` namespace **through the `infra-gitops` repository**
    * _Format_: Will have the same format as that of `infra-gitops-creds` secret
    * _Use for_: Syncing apps GitOps repository
    * _Comment_: Once you have the both the repositories bootstrapped with ArgoCD, the first thing we will need to do for our pipelines to function is to connect pipeline-as-code to our applications repository. We do this using a Repository CR. The Repository CR references a couple of secrets to connect with the application's repository in the SCM.
    * _Deployment Process_: To deploy the `apps-gitops-creds`, follow the below-mentioned steps:
        1. Navigate to your `infra-gitops-config` repository
        1. At the base level, your infra repository should already have a folder with cluster name. You can refer to this tutorial for defining your Infra GitOps Repository structure. Open up the relevant cluster folder.
        1. Inside it, create a folder named `gitops-repositories`
        1. Now add an external secret that has the following structure. Remember to replace the placeholder:

<!-- vale off -->
            ```yaml
              apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
              kind: ExternalSecret
              metadata:
                name: apps-gitops-creds
                namespace: rh-openshift-gitops-instance
              spec:
                secretStoreRef:
                  name: stakater-cluster-secret-store
                  kind: ClusterSecretStore
              data:
              - remoteRef:
                  key: git-pat-creds
                  property: username
                secretKey: username
              - remoteRef:
                  key: git-pat-creds
                  property: password
                secretKey: password
              target:
                name: apps-gitops-creds
                template:
                  metadata:
                    labels:
                      argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: repository
                data:
                  name: apps-gitops-creds
                  password: "{{ .password | toString }}"
                  username: "{{ .username | toString }}"
                  project: TENANT_NAME
                  type: git
                  url: "https://github.com/DESTINATION_ORG/apps-gitops-config.git"
            ```

        1. Now open up Vault and open the common-secrets path. Add a secret named git-pat-creds and add two key 'password' and 'username'. Password should have Personal Access Token with that can access your `apps-gitops-config` repository.
        1. Now go to the `argocd-apps` folder in the `infra-gitops-config` repo and add and ArgoCD application pointing to your `gitops-repositories` folder:

            ```yaml
              apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
              kind: Application
              metadata:
                name: gitops-repositories
                namespace: rh-openshift-gitops-instance
              finalizers:
              - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io
              spec:
                destination:
                  server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
                source:
                  path: cluster-name/gitops-repositories
                  repoURL: YOUR_INFRA_REPO_URL
                  targetRevision: main
                  directory:
                    recurse: true
                project: default
                syncPolicy:
                  automated:
                    prune: true
                    selfHeal: true
            ```
<!-- vale on -->

        1. Wait for ArgoCD to sync your changes

### Organization Level Secrets

1. `git-pat-creds`
    * _Purpose_: Used for three reasons:
        1. In the Repository CR so pipeline-as-code can talk to the repository
        1. In create-environment task to get commit hashes
        1. In TronadorConfig to allow Tronador to access the application repository
    * _Owner_: The owner of this secret will be customer's delivery engineer.
    * _Location_: This secret will be deployed in build namespace of all tenants, the namespaces created by Tronador
    * _Deployment Process_: To deploy the git-pat-creds, follow the below-mentioned steps:
        1. Navigate to your `infra-gitops-config` repository
        1. At the base level, your infra repository should already have a folder with cluster name. Open up the tenant-operator-config and create a folder named templates if it is not already there.
        1. Now add a template with the following structure. Remember to replace the placeholders:

            ```yaml
              apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1alpha1
              kind: Template
              metadata:
                name: git-pat-creds
              resources:
                manifests:
                  - apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
                    kind: ExternalSecret
                    metadata:
                      name: git-pat-creds
                    spec:
                      dataFrom:
                        - extract:
                          conversionStrategy: Default
                          key: git-pat-creds
                      refreshInterval: 1m0s
                      secretStoreRef:
                        kind: SecretStore
                        name: tenant-vault-shared-secret-store
                      target:
                        name: git-pat-creds
            ```

        1. Now add a TemplateGroupInstance:

            ```yaml
              apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1alpha1
              kind: TemplateGroupInstance
              metadata:
                name: git-pat-creds
              spec:
                template: git-pat-creds
                selector:
                  matchExpressions:
                    - key: stakater.com/kind
                      operator: In
                      values: [ build, pr ]
                sync: true
            ```

        1. If you have correctly configured your infra repository, ArgoCD should be able to sync the changes and deploy the secret in build namespaces of the tenants

### Repository Level Secrets

1. `[app-name]-ssh-creds`
    * _Purpose_: Used by these Tekton tasks:
        * `git-clone`
        * `push-main-tag`
        * `create-git-tag`
        * `update-cd-repo`
    * _Owner_: Customer's delivery engineer
    * _Location_: In build namespace of the tenant through `apps-gitops` repository
    * _Deployment Process_: To deploy the git-pat-creds, follow the below-mentioned steps:
        1. Navigate to your `apps-gitops-config` repository
        1. Open up the tenant for which you want to deploy this secret.
        1. Now navigate to the folder which bears the name of the application for which you want to run the pipelines.
        1. Open the build folder.
        1. Add an external secret named [app-name]-ssh-creds:

<!-- vale off -->
            ```yaml
              apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
              kind: ExternalSecret
              metadata:
                name: [app-name]-ssh-creds
              spec:
                secretStoreRef:
                  name: tenant-vault-secret-store
                  kind: SecretStore
                refreshInterval: "1m0s"
                target:
                  name: [app-name]-ssh-creds
                  creationPolicy: 'Owner'
                  template:
                    data:
                      id_rsa: "{{ .id_rsa | b64dec | toString }}"
                data:
                  - secretKey: id_rsa
                    remoteRef:
                      key: [app-name]-ssh-creds
                      property: api_private_key
            ```
<!-- vale on -->

        1. Now open up the tenant path in Vault and add a secret named `[app-name]-ssh-creds`. Add a key `api_private_key`. The value should have a private ssh key that has access to your application repository as well as you `apps-gitops-config` repository.
        1. Assuming you have already set up the `apps-gitops-config` repository, you should be able to see the secret deployed to your tenant's build namespace

1. `[app-name]-git-webhook-creds`
    * _Purpose_: Used in the Repository CR. pipeline-as-code needs this to verify the webhook payload set
    * _Owner_: Developer owns this secret
    * _Location_: In build namespace of the tenant through `apps-gitops` repository
    * _Deployment Process_: Follow the below-mentioned steps for deploying the secret:
        1. Navigate to your `apps-gitops-config` repository
        1. Open up the tenant for which you want to deploy this secret.
        1. Now navigate to the folder which bears the name of the application for which you want to run the pipelines.
        1. Open the build folder.
        1. Add an external secret named [app-name]-git-webhook-creds

<!-- vale off -->
            ```yaml
              apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
              kind: ExternalSecret
              metadata:
                name: github-webhook-config
              spec:
                secretStoreRef:
                  name: tenant-vault-secret-store
                  kind: SecretStore
                refreshInterval: "1m0s"
                target:
                  name: github-webhook-config
                  creationPolicy: 'Owner'
                  template:
                    data:
                      provider.token: "{{ .password | toString }}"
                      webhook.secret: "{{ .secret | toString }}"
                data:
                  - secretKey: password
                    remoteRef:
                      key: github-webhook-config
                      property: provider.token
                  - secretKey: secret
                    remoteRef:
                      key: github-webhook-config
                      property: webhook.secret
            ```
<!-- vale on -->
