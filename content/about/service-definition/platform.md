# Platform

## Autoscaling

Node autoscaling is available on few clouds; you can find details in the relevant [cloud section](../cloud-providers/overview.md). You can configure the autoscaler option to automatically scale the number of machines in a cluster.

## Daemonsets

Customers can create and run daemonsets on {{ product_name }}. To restrict daemonsets to only run on worker nodes, use the following `nodeSelector`:

```yaml
...
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    role: worker
...
```

## Multiple Availability Zone

In a multiple availability zone cluster, control plane nodes are distributed across availability zones and at least one worker node is required in each availability zone.

## Node Labels

Custom node labels are created by Stakater during node creation and cannot be changed on {{ product_name }} at this time. However, custom labels are supported when creating new machine pools.

## OpenShift Version

{{ product_name }} is run as a managed service and is kept up to date with the latest OpenShift Container Platform version, see [change management in responsibilities](../responsibilities.md#change-management). Upgrade scheduling to the latest version is available.

## Container Engine

{{ product_name }} runs on OpenShift 4 and uses [CRI-O](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openshift-container-platform-4-now-defaults-cri-o-underlying-container-engine) as the only available container engine.

## Operating System

{{ product_name }} runs on OpenShift 4 and uses Red Hat CoreOS as the operating system for all control plane and worker nodes.

## Upgrades

Upgrades can be done either immediately or be scheduled at a specific date by opening a [support ticket](https://support.stakater.com/index.html).

See the [{{ product_name }} Update Life Cycle](../update-lifecycle.md) for more information on the upgrade policy and procedures.

## Kubernetes Operator Support

All operators listed in the [Operator Hub marketplace](https://operatorhub.io/) should be available for installation. These operators are considered customer workloads, and are not monitored by Stakater SRE, see [customer applications responsibilities](../responsibilities.md#data-and-applications).

## Red Hat Operator Support

Red Hat workloads typically refer to Red Hat-provided operators made available through [Operator Hub](https://operatorhub.io/). Red Hat workloads are not managed by the Stakater SRE team, and must be deployed on worker nodes and must be managed by the customer, see [customer applications responsibilities](../responsibilities.md#data-and-applications).
