# Add Synthetic Monitoring using UptimeRobot

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of configuring UptimeRobot's Endpoint Monitoring to generate alerts for your application on {{ product_name }} based on its availability. Additionally, we'll cover the setup of TLS for secure communication with your application, enhancing data integrity and privacy.

## Objectives

- Enable and configure UptimeRobot's Endpoint Monitoring for your application on {{ product_name }}.
- Generate a self-signed TLS certificate and create a TLS secret in {{ product_name }}.
- Update the Ingress configuration to include TLS settings for secure communication.

## Key Results

- Successful configuration of UptimeRobot Endpoint Monitoring, implementation of TLS for secure communication for your deployed application.

## Tutorial

### Enable Endpoint Monitoring in `values.yaml`

1. You need to add the following lines to your `deploy/values.yaml` file:

  ```yaml
    ## Endpoint Monitor
    endpointMonitor:
      enabled: true
  ```

### Create a TLS Certificate

1. Review the `https` setting in our `application` [chart](https://github.com/stakater/application/tree/master) template for Endpoint Monitor, you'll find out that the `https` is true by default. So for that purpose we need to create a `TLS` certificate.

    ```sh
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/CN=review.<CLUSTER_NAME>.lab.kubeapp.cloud"
    ```

    > Note: Add your cluster name in the above route.

    Now we have our `TLS` certificate and `TLS` key. Save it to a path.

### Create a TLS Secret

1. Let's create `TLS` secret on your cluster. Identify the namespace you are using to deploy the application.

    ```sh
    oc create secret tls review-tls-secret -n <YOUR_NAMESPACE> --cert=/path/to/your/tls.crt --key=/path/to/your/tls.key
    ```

### Update Ingress Configuration in `values.yaml`

1. By default, Endpoint Monitor uses `ingress`. As we already have created `TLS` secret, let's modify it by adding the `TLS` secret to our ingress configuration.

    ```yaml
    # Ingress
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      ingressClassName: openshift-default
      servicePort: http
      hosts:
        - host: review.<CLUSTER_NAME>.kubeapp.cloud
          paths:
          - path: /
            servicePort: 'http'
      tls:
        - secretName: review-tls-secret # TLS Secret name that we created above
          hosts:
            - review.<CLUSTER_NAME>.kubeapp.cloud
    ```

1. Save and run `tilt up` at the root of your directory. Hit the space bar and the browser with `TILT` logs will be shown. If everything is green then the changes will be deployed on the cluster.

1. Navigate to {{ product_name }} to see our configurations. Let's first check ingress, go to your namespace and then switch to Networking > Ingresses.

    ![ingress](images/ingress.png)

    Verify that the Ingress is created with the name `review`.

1. Next, check the Routes. As `TLS` is in use, the route should now have  `https` now. In your namespace, go to Networking > Routes.

    ![route](images/routes.png)

    Confirm that the route has been updated to use `https`.

1. Let's verify our Endpoint Monitor, it should be created by now. Go to Home > Search > Resources, type Endpoint Monitor. If you are in your namespace, you'll see an Endpoint Monitor created there.

    ![endpoint monitor](images/endpoint-monitor.png)

    We have an `Endpoint Monitor` with the name `review`. Awesome!

    You can also view it's YAML, click on the name and go to `yaml`:

    ![endpoint monitor YAML](images/endpoint-monitor-yaml.png)

Great job! You've successfully configured UptimeRobot Endpoint Monitoring to generate alerts for your {{ product_name }} application based on its availability. Now, whenever your application experiences downtime, an alert will be triggered on your UptimeRobot alert contact.
