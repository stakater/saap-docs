# Package the Application

Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a `memcached` pod, or something complex, like a full web app stack with http servers, databases, caches, and so on. We need to package the deployments for our application into a Helm Chart.

We need to decide what Kubernetes resources are required for our application. A workload resource (`deployment`, `statefulset`) coupled with service and service account resource can be a good starting point.

## Objectives

- Package your application for deployment on {{ product_name }} into Helm Chart.

## Key Results

- Create helm chart in deploy/ folder.
- Explore generic Application helm chart.

## Tutorial

### Create a Helm Chart with Application Chart

#### 1. Create "deploy" directory

Create a directory named deploy/ in your repository that will contain the helm chart which will be deployed for our application.

   ```sh
   mkdir deploy
   ```

#### 2. Create `Chart.yaml`

Create A YAML file containing information about the chart called `Chart.yaml`.

   ```sh
   touch Chart.yaml
   ```

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v2
   name: CHART_NAME
   version: 1.0.0
   dependencies: # A list of the chart requirements (optional)
     - name: application
       version: 2.1.13
       repository: https://stakater.github.io/stakater-charts
   appVersion: "0.0.0"
   ```

> This dependency chart allows you to define resources without getting overwhelmed by the complexities of different resource with a simple interface. For a full list of configuration visit the chart repository [here](https://github.com/stakater/application)

#### 3. Create `values.yaml`

Next create a `values.yaml` file for default configuration values for this chart. Lets start by defining values for deployment and service.

   ```sh
   touch values.yaml
   ```

  ```yaml
    application:
      applicationName: APP_NAME
      deployment:
        repository: NEXUS_DOCKER_REG_URL
        tag: 1.0.0
      rbac:
        serviceAccount:
          enabled: true
  ```

#### 4. Rebuild the charts

Run `helm dependency build` to rebuild or update the charts/ directory based on the `Chart.lock` file.

  ```sh
  helm dependency build
  ```

#### 5. View the generated resources

Run `helm template .` to view the resources generated.

  ```sh
  helm template .
  ```

This chart will generate deployment, service account and service custom resources. This will highlight any other errors in the chart as well.

  ```yaml
    # Source: CHART_NAME/charts/application/templates/serviceaccount.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: APP_NAME
      namespace: default
      labels:
        helm.sh/chart: application-2.1.13

    apiVersion: v1

          containers:
          - name: APP_NAME
            image: repository/image-name
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
            resources:
              limits:
                memory: 256Mi
                cpu: 0.5
              requests:
                memory: 128Mi
                cpu: 0.1
            securityContext:
              readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
              runAsNonRoot: true
          serviceAccountName: APP_NAME
  ```

  If you want to add resources that cannot be defined with dependency chart. You can simply add them in the `templates/` folder.

> Visit [Stakater Nordmart Review Web](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-review-web/tree/main/deploy) and [Stakater Nordmart Review API](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-review-api/tree/main/deploy)  to see an example.

### Package Stakater Nordmart Review

Consider the [`stakater-nordmart-review-api`](https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-review-api) application that we containerized earlier.

#### 1. Clone the repository

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/stakater-lab/stakater-nordmart-review-api
  cd stakter-nordmart-review-api
  ```

#### 2. go to deploy/ directory

  ```sh
  cd deploy
  ```

In deploy/ directory you will see the `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml` file and a `templates` directory.

#### 3. Rebuild/update the charts

In deploy/ directory run `helm dependency build`.

  ```sh
  helm dependency build
  ```

You will see the `charts` directory and a `Chart.lock` file has created.

#### 4. View the generated resources

Run `helm template .` to view the resources generated.

  ```sh
  helm template .
  ```

As you run the above command, the generated resources will be shown on the console.

You just packaged `Stakater Nordmart Review Api` application.
