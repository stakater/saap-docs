# Configuring Azure AD identity provider

For Azure AD, two applications are needed, one for group synchronization, and one for the identity provider. These are the steps for identity provider:

1. To enable login with a Microsoft Azure AD account you first have to register an OAuth application on Azure. Login to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Open `Azure Active Directory` service
1. On the left tab under the Manage section, click `App Registrations`
1. Click on `New registration`. Enter `{{ product_name_lower }}` as the name. Under the `Redirect URI` section, choose `Web` and enter the Redirect URI that **will be provided by Stakater Support** and click `Register`:

1. Go to `API permissions` and add the required Microsoft Graph API permissions. Typically, you need these permissions:
    * `User.Read`
    * `openid`
    * `profile`
    * `email`
1. Click on the newly created app `{{ product_name_lower }}`. Click `Certificates & secrets` from the left tab. Click `New client secret`. Under `Expires` pick any option. Under `Description` enter `{{ product_name_lower }}-oidc` and click `Add`:

1. Copy the value of the newly created client secret and note the `Application (client) ID` and `Directory (tenant) ID` of the `{{ product_name_lower }}` app registration from the `Overview` tab. **Send this to Stakater Support**:
