# Configure Infra GitOps repository

Let us set up Stakater Opinionated GitOps Structure.

Stakater's GitOps structure is composed of two repositories; one for deploying infrastructural resources, and one for deploying the application workloads.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using the name `infra-gitops-config` for the former repository and `apps-gitops-config` for the latter.
You can name these two repositories anything you want but make sure the names are descriptive.

Let's set these two repositories up!!

## Objective

* Configure Infra Repository.
* Create your first tenant.

## Key Results

* Create GitOps repository
* Configure Tenant operator resources
* Configure ArgoCD

## Infra GitOps Config

The cluster scoped infrastructural configurations are deployed through this repository.

To make things easier, we have created a [template](https://github.com/NordMart/infra-gitops-config.git) that you can use to create your infra repository.

Team Stakater will create a root [Tenant](https://docs.stakater.com/mto/latest/tutorials/tenant/create-tenant.html), which will then create a root AppProject.
This AppProject will be used to sync all the Applications in `Infra Gitops Config` and it will provide visibility of these Applications in ArgoCD UI to customer cluster admins.

1. Open up your SCM and create any empty repository.

    > Follow along GitHub/GitLab documentation for configuring other organization specific requirements set for source code repositories.

1. Create an external secret on the cluster with read permissions over this repository.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
    kind: ExternalSecret
    metadata:
      name: infra-gitops-creds
      namespace: rh-openshift-gitops-instance
    spec:
      refreshInterval: 1m
      secretStoreRef:
        name: tenant-vault-shared-secret-store
        kind: SecretStore
      data:
        - remoteRef:
            key: git-pat-creds
            property: username
          secretKey: username
        - remoteRef:
            key: git-pat-creds
            property: password
          secretKey: password
      target:
        name: infra-gitops-creds
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: repository
          data:
            name: infra-gitops-creds
            password: '{{ .password | toString }}'
            username: '{{ .username | toString }}'
            project: root-tenant
            type: git
            url: 'INFRA_GITOPS_REPO_URL'
    ```
<!-- vale on -->

    !!! note
        This ExternalSecret uses the personal access token we created in the earlier tutorial.

1. Now let's copy the structure that we saw in the [template](https://github.com/NordMart/infra-gitops-config.git). Add a folder bearing your cluster's name say `dev` at the root of the repository that you just created.
    > If you plan on using this repository for multiple clusters, add a folder for each cluster.
1. Inside the folder created in step 2, add two folders; one named `argocd-apps`, and another one named `tenant-operator-config`
    > The `argocd-apps` folder will contain ArgoCD applications that will _watch_ different resources added to the same repository. Let's spare ourselves from the details for now.
1. Open the `tenant-operator-config` folder and add two folders inside it: `quotas` and `tenants`
1. The tenants folder will contain the tenant you want to add to your cluster. Let's create one called `arsenal` by adding the file below:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1beta1
    kind: Tenant
    metadata:
      name: arsenal
    spec:
      quota: arsenal-large
      owners:
        users:
        - abc@gmail.com
      argocd:
          sourceRepos:
          - 'https://github.com/your-organization/infra-gitops-config'
          - 'https://github.com/your-organization/apps-gitops-config'
          - '<YOUR-NEXUS-REGISTRY-URL>'
      templateInstances:
      - spec:
          template: tenant-vault-access
          sync: true
      namespaces:
      - build
      - dev
      - stage
    ```

    !!! note
        Remember to replace the Helm registry URL in ArgoCD source repositories. You can find the URLs from [here](../../../managed-addons/nexus/explanation/routes.md)

1. We also need to add a quota for our `arsenal` tenant in our `quotas` folder created in step 4. So let's do it using the file below. The name of this quota need to match the name you specified in tenant CR.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1beta1
    kind: Quota
    metadata:
      name: arsenal-large
      annotations:
        quota.tenantoperator.stakater.com/is-default: "false"
    spec:
      resourcequota:
        hard:
          requests.cpu: "16"
          requests.memory: 32Gi
      limitrange:
        limits:
          - defaultRequest:
              cpu: 10m
              memory: 50Mi
            type: Container
    ```

1. Now that the quota and the tenant have been added, let's create an ArgoCD application in the `argocd-apps` folder that will point to these resources and help us deploy them.
Open up the `argocd-apps` folder and add the following file to it:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: CLUSTER_NAME-tenant-operator-config
      namespace: rh-openshift-gitops-instance
    spec:
      destination:
        namespace: rh-openshift-gitops-instance
        server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
      source:
        path: CLUSTER_NAME/tenant-operator-config
        repoURL: 'INFRA_GITOPS_REPO_URL'
        targetRevision: HEAD
        directory:
          recurse: true
      project: root-tenant
      syncPolicy:
        automated:
          prune: true
          selfHeal: true
    ```

    Make sure you replace the `repoURL` depending on the Secret type you generated, e.g., for SSH secret, repoURL should be SSH.  You may also need to change all the instances of `CLUSTER_NAME` with your cluster's name.
    If you notice the path, you will realize that this application is pointing to 'tenant-operator-config' folder housing your tenant and quotas.

## Bootstrapping the Infra GitOps Repository

1. Now that we have the Infra GitOps Repository set up, we can bootstrap it to ArgoCD. Open the cluster and create an ArgoCD application using the below file.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: infra-gitops-config
     namespace: rh-openshift-gitops-instance
   spec:
     destination:
       namespace: rh-openshift-gitops-instance
       server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
     project: default
     source:
       path: <cluster-name>/argocd-apps
       repoURL: 'INFRA_GITOPS_REPO_URL'
       targetRevision: HEAD
     syncPolicy:
       automated:
         prune: true
         selfHeal: true
   ```

1. Login to ArgoCD and check if `infra-gitops-config` application is present. Validate the child application `tenant-operator-config`.

We have set up the basic structure for our infra repository. Let's move on to the apps repository.
