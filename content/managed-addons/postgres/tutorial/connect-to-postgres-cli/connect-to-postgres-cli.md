# Access Postgres CLI via Port Forward

This documentation will help to connect to managed Postgres via `psql` using port forward.

## CLI Setup

The first step is to setup `psql` on your local machine. For this, go through following steps. If you already have CLI setup, you can skip this section.

1. Run following command in terminal:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-client
    ```

1. Run following command to verify CLI installation:

    ```shell
    psql --version
    ```

## Create Port Forwarding to Postgres Service

Before running `psql` command we need to port forward to Postgres Pod running in cluster. To achieve this, perform following steps:

1. In OpenShift console, click on your username on top right corner and click `Copy login command` as shown below:

    ![`OpenShift Console`](../images/openshift-console.png)

1. Click on `Display Token` and then copy `oc login` command.
1. Run this command inside your terminal. Now you have access to interact with your cluster using terminal.
1. Run following command to locate the pod to which we need to create port forward.

    ```shell
    PG_CLUSTER_PRIMARY_POD=$(oc get pod -n <postgres-namespace> -o name -l postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/cluster=<postgres-cluster>,postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/role=master)
    ```

    Here `<Postgres-namespace>` is the name of namespace where Postgres is deployed (In current case its value is `crunchy-postgres-instance`). This name might be different for you. You can ask about this to cluster admin. `<Postgres-cluster>` is the name of cluster in Postgres that usually get created at time of deployment (In current case its value is `postgres`). You can ask about its name from cluster admin as well.

1. Upon printing the value stored in variable mentioned above, you'll get an output similar to one shown below:

    ![`Postgres Pod Name`](../images/postgres-pod.png)

1. Run the following command to create port forward.
  
    ```shell
    oc port-forward "${PG_CLUSTER_PRIMARY_POD}" <port> -n <postgres-namespace>
    ```

    - `<port>` is the port number for this pod to which we need to create port forward. In current case its value is `5432`

    - This should result in following output:

        ![`Postgres Port Forward`](../images/postgres-port-forward.png)

1. At this moment, you need to open a second terminal (while keeping this running) and run following command:
  
    ```shell
    psql -h localhost -U $PGUSER -d $PGDATABASE
    ```
  
    - `$PGUSER` is a reference to a variable that must be set (or you can replace this with username) used to connect to Postgres. This can easily be retrieved from OpenBao.
    - `$PGDATABASE` contains name of the database that you want to connect to. This can also be retrieved from OpenBao.

    - This should result in following output:

        ![`Postgres Password Prompt`](../images/postgres-password-promt.png)

    - Paste in the password that you can get from OpenBao.

1. At this moment, you should have access to `psql`. You can run `\q` at anytime to exit out of this terminal access.

## Caveat

When using `oc port-forward`, the connection can be fragile. This has been reported as an [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/111825). A workaround is to disable SSL mode.
